    "##### 1) Fixed Acidity = It is the amount of non-volatile acids (mainly tartaric acid) present in the wine. These acids are responsible for the wine to taste sharp, tart and don't evaporate easily. Higher values of fixed acidity implies more acidic wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Volatile Acidity = The amount of acetic acids and other acids that can evaporate. High values of these cause the wine to have an unpleasant vinegar like taste and smell. Prefarable to have lesser values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) Citric Acid = This is a weak acid that gives the wine a citric flavor and brings freshness. Sometimes winemakers add citric acid to wines to brighten them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4) Residual Sugar = Residual sugar is the amount of sugar left in the wine after the process of fermentation stops. Usually it is very low in dry wines like red wine. Higher values would indicate a sweeter wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5) Chlorides = This indicates the salt content (Sodium Chloride and others) present in the wine. Too much chlorides makes the wine taste salty or harsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6) Free sulphur dioxide = It is the amounnt of SO2 not bound to other molecules. It protects the wine from spoilage and oxidation as it acts like a preservative and antioxidant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7) Total sulphur dioxide = Total sulphur dioxide present in the wine, including the free and bound forms. High amounts can cause a chemical smell and it is regulated as people are sensitive to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 8) Density = How thick/dense the wine is compared to water. It is influenced by alcohol and sugar content, higher sugar or lower alcohol increases the density.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 9) pH = This value measures how acidic or basic the wine is on a standard scale of 0 to 14. Lower the pH, more acidic is the wine. Typical red wines have a pH between 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10) Sulphates = This refers to the potassium sulphate or other sulphate compounds added by the winemakers. They are useful in preservation and enhancing the flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 11) Alcohol = The percentage of alcohol in wine by volume (% ABV). Higher alcohol percentages gives a warmer mouthfeel and can give a perception of sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12) Target (Quality) = A score given most probably by wine experts on a scale of 0 to 10. In this red wine dataset, the wines are rated between 3 and 8. Higher scores means better overall quality of the wine. This is the feature we will try to predict."
